# neuron-trace-analysis
Code for analyzing electrophysiology data.
This code largely dates from my time as a postdoc. It is mostly not under active development, although I occasionally make changes when people I know ask for bug-fixes or updates. If I was to resume active development, I would do many things differently, however I will likely maintain things as is, in order to provide backwards compatibility for friends and colleagues.

The most useful function is probably the spike detector: GetSpikes.m
